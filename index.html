        <h2>About Me</h2>
         <img style="width: 200px" src="images/headshot.jpg" alt="Portrait of Chris">
         <p>My name is Chris Etges, and I have recently begun my journey towards becoming a full
        time web-developer. I am currently enrolled in the full-stack web development course
        at the University of Denver. I started learning HTML and CSS through codeacademy, and continued
        with courses through the University of Michigan online (via Coursera) in Javascript and Responsive
        Design. I continue to learn and grow and improve my skills. I hope to become a full-time web developer
        in front-end technologies, though once I become more familiar with backend technologies I'm hoping 
        to be a full-stack developer. I've been interested in tech as a hobby for my entire life, and frequently
        mess around with beta programs, and custom ROM installs on my Android devices. I'm an avid gamer, and
        love photography and travel. You'll see a few of my website projects in my portfolio, and feel free to 
        reach out to me for custom work or questions. Thanks!
          </p>
